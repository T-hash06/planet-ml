## üî≠ The Science Behind ExoNova

### The Transit Method

ExoNova specializes in detecting exoplanets using the **transit method**, the most successful technique in the field. When a planet passes in front of its host star (as viewed from Earth), it blocks a small fraction of the star's light, creating a temporary dip in brightness. By analyzing these subtle changes in stellar light curves, our AI models can identify planetary candidates with high confidence.

### Dual-Model AI Architecture

ExoNova employs two complementary artificial intelligence models working in tandem:

#### 1. **CTAB-GAN+**: Synthetic Data Generation & Imputation
- Generates physically plausible synthetic exoplanet samples to augment training data
- Handles missing values in observational datasets
- Preserves complex correlations between astronomical parameters
- Addresses class imbalance in rare planetary configurations

#### 2. **Masked Autoencoder (MAE)**: Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection
- Detects transit signals in time-series light curves
- Learns robust stellar behavior patterns from unlabeled observations
- Processes both temporal and tabular astronomical data
- Provides reconstruction-based anomaly scores for classification confidence

This dual-pathway approach combines the strengths of generative modeling and self-supervised learning to achieve unprecedented accuracy in planetary discovery.
